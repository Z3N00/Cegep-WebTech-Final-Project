# Coding environment

If you want to develop and make HTML websites, you will need to download any HTML or Javascript Editor. That will make your life easier

You can do it in Notepad or any Text Editor as well But  I would strongly advise making sure you have
any IDE that supports HTML & JAVASCRIPT.

# Let’s get started!

Now that you have Webstorm  downloaded, let’s go ahead and open it up.
